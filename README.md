 **Day 6 of My Python Learning Journey** — Conditional Statements (if, elif, else) 🐍

Today was all about **making decisions in Python** — using the powerful `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. This is how programs learn to *think* and act based on different situations. 🧠✨


🔹 **if**
Used when you want to run a block of code only *if* a specific condition is true.

🔸 **elif (else if)**
Gives you more conditions to check, if the first `if` condition wasn't met.

🔹 **else**
A fallback — runs when none of the above conditions are true.

📌 **Real-life example:**
Ever ordered food online?
If it's available — it gets delivered.
Elif it's unavailable — you might see alternatives.
Else — you get a "not available" message.
That’s `if-elif-else` in action! 🍕➡️🚫

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Conditional statements are the decision-makers in your code. They control the flow and make your program behave dynamically based on real-time data or logic.

One step closer to writing smarter Python programs! 💪
